# Mystical
Mystical is a server-side fabric mod, meant to spice up gameplay. (It will still run on your machine, you don't need a remote server)
As you play, a mysterious force casts spells over the world, changing game mechanics and adding new challenges. Think of those chaos mods that people stream on twitch, but more sensible. It won't destroy your fun or your world in a few hours.

Mystical is **highly configurable**, **open-source**, and **awesome**.

Please feel free to ask questions or contribute to the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/skycatminepokie/mystical). Known issues, bugs, and future plans are also on GitHub.
